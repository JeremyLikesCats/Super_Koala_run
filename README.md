# Super Koala Run

This is a game made in collaboration with MrKoalaGames (https://github.com/MrKoalaGames) in Y9 for a school project! 

# About

We programmed this game mainly to hone and improve our programming skills, and learn some practical applications of programming.

Despite this, we made many mistakes that we learned from. One of the newer games I programmed with another classmate is here: (https://github.com/JeremyLikesCats/Digestion-game)
### Things to improve
- Optimisation!!
- Organization of code
- More polishing for stability
